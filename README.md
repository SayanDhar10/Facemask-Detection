# Facemask-Detection
This repository presents a reliable face mask detection system built using PyTorch and the MobileNetV2 architecture. It classifies images into two categories: *with\_mask* and *without\_mask*. The implementation features a complete training pipeline, including data augmentation, automatic train-validation splitting, and thorough evaluation metrics.
